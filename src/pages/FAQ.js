            <h2>Tutorial 1: What is investment? (with definition of basic terms)</h2>
          
            <t1>Let's start with what investment actually is and why you should start investing NOW!
            <br />
            Investment involves steaking money with a company, government etc. in order to earn money on this money.
            <br />
            Investment can help with early retirement and quality of life.

            Risk is a valid worry when investing. Some investments are more riskier than others and there is usually a way to estimate the riskiness beforehand.
            <br />
            Types of Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, ETFs, Real Estate, Currency etc.
            <br />
            Stock markets are where investments are bought and sold.
            <br />
            Compounding causes your investment to grow exponentially over time, thus it is critical to invest even small sums as early as you can in life.
            <br />
            Trading is a risky form of short-term investment.
            <br />
            Inflation is 2.5% a year, money reduces value on average 2.5% a year and thus if you leave money in an account rather than investing it, it is worth 2.5 less each year.
            <br /> 
            Diversification means investing in different geographies, industries and asset classes.
