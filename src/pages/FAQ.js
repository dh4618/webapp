            <t1>Let's start with what investment actually is!
            <br />
            Investment involves steaking money with a company, government etc. in order to earn money on this money.
            <br />

Risk is a valid worry when investing. Some investments are more riskier than others and there is usually a way to estimate the riskiness beforehand.
 
Types of Investments: Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, ETFs, Real Estate, Currency etc.
 
Stock markets are where investments are bought and sold.
 
Compounding causes your investment to grow exponentially over time, thus it is critical to invest even small sums as early as you can in life.
 
Trading is a risky form of short-term investment.
 
Inflation is 2.5% a year, money reduces value on average 2.5% a year and thus if you leave money in an account rather than investing it, it is worth 2.5 less each year.
 
Diversification means investing in different geographies, industries and asset classes.
